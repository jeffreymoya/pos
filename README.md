# Waylocate

## Overview

This React Native project, named Waylocate, is a dynamic and event-driven mobile application designed to provide location service discovery from Google, Waze and Facebook. Leveraging the power of React Native, Redux, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, TypeScript, and Redux Observable, this project aims to provide a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Key Features

- **Redux State Management:** Utilizing Redux and Redux Toolkit for efficient state management, ensuring a predictable and scalable application state.

- **RTK Query Integration:** Harnessing the capabilities of RTK Query to simplify data fetching, caching, and state management for improved API interactions.

- **TypeScript for Strong Typing:** The entire codebase is written in TypeScript, offering enhanced code quality, autocompletion, and type checking to catch errors during development.

- **Redux Observable for Reactive Programming:** Leveraging Redux Observable for handling asynchronous operations and creating a reactive and responsive application architecture.

- **Event-Driven Design:** The project follows an event-driven design paradigm, promoting a modular and loosely coupled architecture for easy scalability and maintainability.
